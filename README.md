# Data Analysis of Olympics
Data Analysis or sometimes referred to as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is one of the core components of data science. It is also the part on which data scientists, data engineers and data analysts spend their majority of the time which makes it extremely important in the field of data science.

This repository demonstrates some common EDA methods and techniques using Python. For purpose of illustration the 120 Years of Olympic Analysis history dataset has been taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) since it is one of the ideal dataset for performing EDA and taking a step towards the most amazing and interesting field of data science. <br/>


The modern Olympic Games are the most important international sporting events, with summer and winter sports tournaments involving thousands of competitors from all over the world.
With over 200 nations competing, the Olympic Games are regarded as the world's premier sporting event. The Olympic Games are generally held every four years, and since 1994, the Summer and Winter Olympics have alternated every two years throughout the four-year period.
